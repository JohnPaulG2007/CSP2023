	<p>  This is my 1.1.9 project. I made a record player that changes the albumn color based on which one you select. This record player plays the color of whatever albumn color you chose. I made this project with a partner using 4 loops, condtionals, and iterations. This is my 1.1.9 project!</p>

	<p> This is my 1.2.5 project. I made a game called Apple Sorter and you can move your basket from left to right that catches apples. If you catch the wrong apple or drop 3 apples then you lose or if time runs out. I made this project along side Samantha and Ryoka using loops, conditionals, iterations and many other methods. This is my 1.2.5 project! </p>
